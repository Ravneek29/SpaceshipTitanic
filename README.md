## Project Overview
The Spaceship Titanic Survival Prediction project involves predicting passenger survival on the spaceship Titanic. This project is inspired by the Titanic competition on Kaggle, but with a futuristic twist. The aim is to apply machine learning techniques to determine which passengers survived the disaster.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about passengers such as their ID, name, age, cabin, and other relevant features. The goal is to use these features to predict survival.

## Installation
To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spaceship-titanic.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd spaceship-titanic
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
To use this project, open the Jupyter Notebook `SpaceshipTitanic.ipynb` in your preferred environment. Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.

## Project Structure
- `SpaceshipTitanic.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset.
- `models/`: Directory to save trained models.
- `requirements.txt`: File containing the list of dependencies.

## Results
The project results include the accuracy of the survival predictions, as well as insights gained from analyzing the dataset. These results are documented in the notebook.
